       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Page iiiNotes: The German word “Gemütlichkeit” is difficult to fully translate or explain. It means you are in the presence of good food, good company, a drink or two, and plenty of time to enjoy it all! Gemütlichkeit induces a cheerful mood and peace of mind, with connotations of belonging and social acceptance, coziness, and relax-ation. It not only describes an atmosphere but also a state of mind, and refers to being laid back, or to not being stressed in the least, due to your surroundings and the well-being of the present company surrounding you.As an adjective, gemütlich describes a person who is equal parts “good-natured” and “in a good mood,” with “sociable,” “genial,” “jovial,” and “unhurried” thrown in. Gemütlichkeit describes the quality of the social setting that arises when a number of gemütlich people come together. The expression “g’suffa” (pronounced “g-soofa”) is from the Bavarian term “gesoffen” and is an order “to guzzle, chug, gulp, or drink down.”As a celebratory chant, the band leader calls out “Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke!” to which the band members, along with the audience, answer, “hoi, hoi, hoi!”A Salute to Y our Well-being!If you have the opportunity, find a German restaurant that offers live entertainment. While enjoying traditional cuisine, diners may be called upon to take part in a traditional song, after which you take a large swig of your favorite beverage.“Ein Prosit” [Sang with beer stein or glass in hand, waving to and fro!]\\nGermanEnglishEin Prosit, Ein Prosit, der GemütlichkeitA Toast, A Toast, to HappinessEin Prosit, Ein Prosit, der GemütlichkeitA Toast, A Toast, to HappinessEins, zwei, drei, g’suffa!One, Two, Three, “Down the hatch”!Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi,Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, Hey, Hey, Hey!

Since those early arriv-als, millions more took the journey, with many still immigrating to the USA in the 21st century.Generations of Germanic descendants contin-ue to influence the culture and traditions of the American landscape.Few people realize that, today, tens of millions of descen-dents of these pio-neers comprise the largest single immi-grant group in what is now the United States of America. They make up about 20 percent of the population.In the last US Census (2010), the population with Germanic roots grew to 49.8 million citizens, reflecting a jump of 6 million people since 2000. The next largest heritage group is Irish, with those from African and English ancestry following close behind.A Country Built on ImmigrantsGermans were among the first settlers of the New World, having joined the initial waves of migration from Europe.However, the largest population of Germanic people came to America between about 1820 and 1914, with the peak period coming by the early 1880s. By 1890, over seven and a half million folks from Germania came to the United States — more than doubling the entire population of the country.Many settled  in the states of the Upper Mid-west, an area known to this day as America’s “German Belt.”What Brought Them Here?Historians identify a mix of factors underlying immigration, though much of it was based on socio-economic distress in areas of German-speaking Central Europe.Along with the promise of eco-nomic prosperity and opportunities in America, emi-gration appealed to those who wanted to escape political turmoil, civil unrest, and even forced mili-tary conscription.Interestingly, related to the latter point, while some Germanic immigrants came to America seeking freedom from required military service, many were proud to serve honorably, fighting bravely for their new land, on both sides of the American Revolutionary and Civil wars.Suffering hardships in their homelands, they made the difficult choice to seek liberty in Ameri-ca, where they had the promise of better lives and opportunities. Most notably, they had a quest to own land. As long as they were willing to work hard once they arrived, they dreamed of gaining financial security, notably through land ownership \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='Page 2and stewardship. Being able to own land was diffi-cult in their homelands.The promise of the “American Dream” included to prospect of personal property rights that would allow families to pass their wealth and homestead lands on to their descendants. In the nineteenth century this meant a lot for rural folks and those who sought a simple life on a farm.Many descendants of the early settlers maintain a significant amount of wealth through inter-gener-ational transfers of wealth. It is not uncommon for the top one percent of wealth in a city to be among families that still own their original land on which their forefather’s settled, and a lot of wealth remains within the German-American community.From Where Did They Come?While most believe German-Americans descend from the modern-day country of Germany, the reality is there was no country known as “Germa-ny” during the period of mass migration. Anybody who spoke German was considered German. It was the a primary language in the land area of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, from eastern France to Switzerland and Austria.  (Outside of these Germanic-populations, the majority of the rest of immigrants were northern or western Europeans.)Who are German-Americans?German-Americans are known for a strong work ethic. In the New World, the Industrial Revolution led to burgeoning growth in the number of companies that were able to absorb all the new workers. Immi-grants first built water canals that started moving goods across much of the eastern U.S. and eventu-ally constructed the railroads that opened up the rest of the country. Hardworking immigrants were the backbone for every labor-intensive endeavor in the country.Today, German-Americans are somewhat better educated and more white collar than the general population, with one-third having at least a bach-elor’s degree and about 40 percent employed in management, business, science or the arts. They tend to be more settled in their communities and are happy exactly where they are.As the largest single ethnic group in the United States, German traditions and heritage have found a way to permeate into most aspects of American culture. German-Americans promote education, thriftiness and an entrepreneurial spirit. They also brought with them a diverse range of religious be-liefs, promoting tolerance and understanding.The peace-loving descendants of these individu-als include the modern Mennonites, Brethren, and Amish religious denominations.For example, the Amana colonies of Iowa were founded by German-speaking people who sought religious freedoms. Their church is The Communi-ty of True Inspiration, an off-shoot of Lutheranism.Today, their  seven, once-communal villages have grown in popularity to become some of Iowa’s most visited tourist attractions. (Some recipes here-in are graciously provided by the Amana Colonies.)Similar religious groups are dispersed across the USA, though are frequently near larger Germanic communities, predominantly in the states of Penn-sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Texas.Other large, well-established communities of German-heritage families and Mennonite Com-munities live in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington states).What Did They Risk?Our predecessors gave up everything, including the lives they knew, to journey to the New World. They followed their dreams in search of freedom and opportunities for increased prosperity.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Page 3What Germanic People Offered the New WorldAlready-stated, colonial immigrants from Ger-many were admired for their work ethic. But they are also known historically for their thriftiness and especially for their neat and prosperous farms, as well as the pride they took in old-world craftsman-ship. A quick look at their hand-crafted items will show you the quality and detail lovingly integrat-ed into their furniture and other manufactured goods. Their craftsmanship is still found today, in high-end furniture makers.Although not widely-known, German-Ameri-cans contributed mightily to the de-fense of American democracy and freedom extending back to Colonial days.During the War of Independence, Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, a former Prussian captain and adjutant of Frederick the Great, became the Inspector General for the American army. He was able to expertly blend Prussian military doctrines with the backwoods fighting tactics being used in those days by the Continental Army.While some Americans of Germanic descent have forefathers who fought for American Inde-pendence, many others are descendants of men who fought on either side of the Civil War. Others battled gallantly in every conflict since.Today, members of German-American Societies across the United States work hard to strengthen our government, extending and promoting liberty.Where are German-Americans Located?According to traditional accounts of immigra-tion, German settlers were drawn to landscapes that resembled the areas they came from in Eu-rope,  such as rural Wisconsin.They were especially drawn to heavily wooded areas, where they were far more fastidious and successful stewards of the land than the Yankees. The symbolic and practical importance of the forest in German culture, particularly during the nineteenth century, reinforced this romantic view of German settlers.Scholarship on nineteenth-cen-tury immigration indicates that local, practical realities were more im-portant in guiding Germans to choose where to settle than innate cultur-al inclinations.Many early settlers traveled wherever they were afforded economic opportunities. The stereotype persists of rootless, enterprising Americans eagerly following a quick buck in their pursuit of the American Dream.However, Germanic Americans tended to invest huge amounts of time and resources in their land.German settlers valued a varied landscape and were generally less likely to move once they had established themselves in a particular location. Certainly, popular narratives endure, focusing on the closeness of these settlers to their land.During the Industrial Revolution, like other Americans, German-Americans eventually migrat-\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='Page 4ed to the cities from rural landscapes. Spreading far-and-wide, they sought economic opportunities in urban manufacturing plants.Today, a “German belt” extends across the Unit-ed States, from eastern Pennsylvania to the Oregon coast.Pennsylvania has the largest population of Ger-man-Americans in the US and is home to one of the group’s original settlements, Germantown, that was established in 1683. The state has 3.5 million people of German heritage, a figure that outpaces the population of Berlin.Germanic people comprise a majority of coun-ties in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Missou-ri, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas.While the German communities on the West Coast may be smaller in comparison, pride in their heritage is just as strong. Consider, the annual Mt. Angel Oktoberfest, just outside of Salem, Oregon, is one of the largest annual celebrations of its kind throughout the entire U.S. It attracts upwards of 350,000 people during its annual four-day run.Outside the German Belt, German-Americans are commonly found in non-coastal states, includ-ing a large number in Maricopa County, Arizona. Smaller communities are located as far away as the southern tip of Florida to the Hawaiian islands, in the Pacific Ocean.German Cultural Traditions and CelebrationsRoughly 70  million strong, people of German-ic descent are proud of their heritage and their long-standing cultural traditions that persist today. Their influences are found in American cuisine and the development of the nation itself. (Just think of pretzels and hot dogs or the American education system that starts with kindergarten.)Many long-standing cultural traditions take place throughout America, most notably decorat-ing a Christmas tree in the winter and Easter eggs in the spring.Others traditions include the lively dancing and entertainment common at annual Oktoberfests throughout America, along with some smaller festivals, including Maifest (Spring Celebration, literally, “May Festival”) and lesser-known region-al celebrations such as Cincinnati’s RoeblingFest and German-American Heritage Month. The most common celebrations include: • Oktoberfest (Autumn Celebration; literally, “Octo-ber Festival”) • Maifest (Spring Celebration; literally, “May Festi-val”) • Schützenfest (Shooting or Marksmen’s Festival) • German-American Day, celebrated on October 6thOktoberfestGerman culture is best represented in the USA with the seasonal celebration of Oktoberfest, which is held in many local communities. It is by far the most widely-celebrated German festival in Ameri-ca. Traditionally, the annual harvest jubilation lasts 16 days, beginning in the third week of September and ending the first Sunday of October each year.These harvest festivals continue to promote the traditions of the original jubilee in Munich, which began to celebrate a royal wedding.In fact, many of those with German heritage make a pilgrimage to Bavaria at least once in their lives to experience the original, centuries-old tra-dition of Oktoberfest and its associated Gemütlich-keit (a feeling of warmth, friendship, hospitality, and coziness).Whether in Munich or in towns across Ameri-can, the annual gathering involves customary garb '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Page 5with men clad in Lederhose (lederhosen in English) and ladies in their Dirndls. Singing time-honored songs and dancing to festive music from upbeat polka bands is only a part of the fun. The beer, bratwurst, and Gemütlichkeit complete the festiv-ities.Many people believe the Oktoberfest is nothing more than a drinking festival, although nothing could be further from the truth!The vast majority of events are extremely fam-ily-friendly, and most festivals separate areas of heavy drinking from the Kinder (children). It pres-ents a grand opportunity for people of German de-scent to come together and celebrate their heritage with traditional food, clothes, songs, and dance.On the West Coast is the Oktoberfest celebration in Mount Angel, Oregon. This four-day festival draws more than three hundred thousand peo-ple from all over the Pacific Northwest annually. Likewise, the Wurstfest in New Braunfels, Texas, lasts for ten days and draws tens of thousands of tourists. Over a hundred thousand people take part in Milwaukee’s annual German Fest.All of these events take hundreds of volunteers to plan each year, and they generate an enormous amount of revenue for the communities. Families return year after year, generation after generation, adding to the traditions.The regional celebrations in the US are often held over weekends, sometime from September to October. Larger celebrations often last for several weekends, while smaller ones may span only a day or two.If you have never attended an Oktoberfest, we encourage you to try it out this year. Every guest is an honorary German during the festival!Origins of OktoberfestOktoberfest was first held in Munich on October 12, 1810, to celebrate the marriage of the Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hild-burghausen. The citizens of Munich were all invited to attend the festivities, which were held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the joyous royal event. The people of Munich renamed the field that held the original wedding celebration Theresienwiese (Therese’s Fields) to honor their new princess.Even though the event has evolved into more of an agricultural fair, seeing the opportunity for an ongoing party, the people of Munich continue to celebrate in the same location each year in the huge Augustiner–Festhalle (Big Tent). To learn more about the modern Oktoberfest celebration, see www.oktoberfest-live.deOktoberfests in the United States don’t necessar-ily follow the same blueprint as the original jubilee in Munich, though they continue to promote its joyous traditions with a jovial spirit designed to appeal to both children and adults alike.Maifest (Spring Celebration)Maifest (Mayfest), another traditional German celebration, marks the arrival of Spring. Its iconic Maibaum (May Pole) is decorated to show off the history and crafts of the town. As a celebration outside of Germany, it is growing in popularity throughout the United States. It is similar to Ok-toberfest (the annual celebration of the arrival of Autumn).Schützenfest (Shooting or Marksmen’s Festival)Another lesser-known festival is the Schützen-fest. This is traditional fair features target shooting competitions, most common in the cultures of both Germany and Switzerland. Competitors shoot at a wooden target that represents an eagle and the winner is crowned the ‘Schützenkönig’, or “King of the Marksmen”.Modern-day competitions recognize the historic need for each towns’ self defense against armed '),\n",

Historical-ly, militia groups from among the local men were formed to practice their shooting skills and gain competency. Over the ensuing centuries, many paramilitary clubs and associations were found-ed and became integrated into the towns’ official defense plans, having been first sanctioned in the “Law for the Defensive Constitution of the Towns” by King Henry I.German-American Day (October 6th)Few people are aware that German-Americans have a formal annual holiday to celebrate our Ger-man-American heritage. German-American Day originates from the 19th century and is observed throughout the United States on October 6.The date commemorates the October 6, 1683, landing in Philadelphia of the first group of 13 German Mennonite families. Emigrating from Krefeld near the Rhine and seeking religious toler-ance, these families subsequently founded the first German settlement in the original thirteen Amer-ican colonies: Germantown, Pennsylvania. These families stepping foot in America marked the start of a wave of German migration that would bring millions of people to our shores.Many individual Germans were part of the foundation of the New World, having traveled here during the first waves of European settlers. In fact, some were part of the very first settlement in Jamestown, in 1608. Not too long afterward, a Rhinelander, Peter Minuit, became famous as the director of the Dutch colony who bought Manhat-tan from Native Americans in 1626.An informal “German-American Day” was ini-tially celebrated throughout the nineteenth centu-ry, but interest in commemorating the day fizzled during the anti-German sentiment that prevailed after World War I.The historical significance of the day was revived in 1983 when President Reagan proclaimed the “Tricentennial Anniversary Year of German Settle-ment in America.” This recognized the 300th anni-versary of the arrival of those first German-Amer-ican families. Four years later, in 1987, Congress designated October 6th as German-American Day.President Reagan signed Public Law 100-104 on August 18th, 1987, issuing a formal proclamation (#5719) on October 2, in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. He called on Americans to observe the National Day with appropriate ceremo-nies and activities.“Few people have blended so completely into the multicultural tapestry of American society and yet have made such singular economic, political, social, scientific, and cultural contributions to the growth and success of these United States as have Americans of German extraction.” - President Ronald Reagan, 1987  A few individuals were instrumental in estab-lishing German-American Day. These included Elsbeth Seewald, the president of the German American National Congress (DANK); Drs. Eber-hard and Ruth Reichmann of the German Her-itage Society of Indiana; and Dr. Don Heinrich Tolzmann of the Society for German-American Studies. Several thousand other citizens then peti-tioned Congress to bring the day to fruition.In 1988, one year after the formal holiday was established, DANK, the United German Ameri-can Committee of the U.S.A., Inc. (VDAK), and the Steuben Society of America, joined together with the founding of the German American Joint Action Committee (GAJAC).Enlisting support throughout the nation, GA-JAC subsequently petitioned Congress and leaders throughout all levels of state and national govern-ment to issue resolutions and proclamations for the annual German American Day on October 6th.Following in the footsteps of those emigrant families from October 6, 1683, a wave of German '),\n",

Over the next three hundred years, more than sev-en million additional German immigrants landed on the shores of the New World.All these people and their descendants worked hard, making extraordinary human, economic, political, social, and cultural contributions to the growth and success of our great country.Today, more than seventy million Americans – nearly a quarter of all Americans – can trace their ancestry back to Germanic roots. More Americans claim German ancestry than any other ethic group.The special day continues to grow, recognizing the rich legacy of German-Americans everywhere. It is a day to honor and celebrate the cultural influ-ence, hard work, and sacrifice all those of German heritage have brought to the New World.Slogans of German-American SocietiesGerman-American societies exist in every large American city. They have adopted many mottos and slogans, including the following:• “Jungs Holt Fast.” (Men Hold Fast.)• “Einigkeit Makt Stark.” (In Oneness There is Strength.)• “Von den Deutschen, für die Deutschen.” (From the Germans, for the Germans.)• “What you have inherited from your fathers: earn it, to possess it.”The International German American SocietyThe International German American Society supports and celebrates Germans everywhere. Our goal is to cultivate a greater awareness of Ger-man-American heritage and history. At over 50 million strong, people of Germanic descent con-tinue to have a strong cultural influence through-out the United States. Our outreach efforts aim to continue enriching the American culture, while providing a deepened understanding of the offer-ings brought to our nation.Like most locally-established centers, we are organized exclusively for educational and social purposes that include cultivating German culture and traditions. Our primary mission is to promote and honor German traditions, including music, dancing, and choral singing (choirs). We respect the German tongue and those seeking to get in touch with their roots by learning it. Depending on the locality of an organization or club, there are bound to be many members who are first-gener-ation immigrants from German-speaking lands who are eager to help others learn more.The International German American Society shall continue prospering in the years to come as we support national interests of all German-Amer-icans. We will continue to develop and promote international relationships with Germany.In order to support our members, we graciously accept donations to support or mission. We will continue to help strengthen existing organizations and help with fundraising efforts for our members. We will also work to find strategic combinations to make complementary local organizations stronger by merging their respective operations.German-American Societies & ClubsThroughout the United States, there are Ger-man-American Clubs and Societies with long and proud histories. Some of them have been around for well over a hundred years.At the turn of the 20th century, thousands of German organizations existed throughout every corner of the United States. The Societies’ great his-tories helped cultivate respect for our shared histo-ry. Their members served with pride to create local traditions, and they worked hard to contribute to the growth of their cities. Together, they have lived through periods of both glorious financial prosper-ity and severe economic depression.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Page 8Due to the negative social pressure after the First and Second World Wars, membership in the organizations waned. By the 1960s, this impacted the number of organization. For the most part, they could be found only near major US cities or those areas where a large number of families of Germanic-heritage still predominate. In order to remain viable where families are dissipating, many remaining groups have merged together in order to gain strength.Some of the larger societies and clubs continue to boast high membership levels. For example, the German-American Society Inc. in Omaha Nebraska has over 1,100 members. With its many activities and community involvement, it remains a major German cultural center in the Midwest. It has done a lot to build strong friendships in edu-cational and cultural activities between Germany and Omaha.This great Society, like many others throughout the United States, has a long history. Its building housed Father Edward Flanagan and his boys from 1917 to 1921. After more than 1,200 homeless boys lived at the German Home, the Father had to move on to find a larger facility. At that time, he estab-lished Boys Town, ten miles west of Omaha, in 1921.Today, Societies and Clubs throughout America routinely schedule dinners and dances to share in the tradition of German Gemütlichkeit.Open to the public, they are designed to share German cuisine and culture in a festive and fun-filled way that usually includes a good dose of hu-mor, poetry, and of course German dance and mu-sic. At any of these events, you will hear and dance to authentic German Polkas and Waltzes (and be amused by the Americanized Chicken Dance).The purpose of each social group under our ban-ner is to offer hospitality to all people of German extraction and to offer a place where members can join closely together for traditional celebrations of the homeland of our ancestors.‘America cultivates the best which Germany brought forth.’ — Benjamin FranklinPopular German Proverbs• Being in good company is better than being alone.• All in good time.• To begin is easy. To persist is an art.• Adversity is the mother of wisdom.• Don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill.• Do not bite the hand that feeds you.• Do not judge others by your own yardstick.• A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.• Blood is thicker than water.• If life gives you lemons, make lemonade.• Buy cheaply, pay dearly.• Strike while the iron is hot.• Fortune favors the bold.•  Honesty lasts longest.• Love your neighbor; but don’t pull down the fence.• Idleness is the beginning of all evil.• A hearth of ones own is worth its weight in gold.• A good word costs nothing.• He who begins much ends little.'),\n",

Anyone can gather there to enjoy the unique flavors in German and Bavarian dishes, while at the same time sharing the cultural heritage and keeping traditions alive.Multiple parties may be seated together, and table service is often served family style. Buffets are not as common, though quick-serve options are avail-able in some locales.German and Bavarian style meals have unique flavors. Traditional German meals almost always revolve around meat, where dishes are often pan cooked or stewed. Roasts are frequently prepared on the stove.During the late-18th through the early part of the 19th centuries, main daily meals included cours-es featuring fish, pork, and game, available fresh from the forests, farms, or lakes. (Families not able to hunt nor afford the luxury of large cuts of meat could at least include nice hearty chunks in a stew of fresh vegetables.)Meat remains the mainstay of the German din-ner table today, where main courses may include options with locally-grown pork, beef, chicken, and pork (cured or smoked ham, sausages, and brats), together with overflowing side dishes, including sauerkraut and red cabbage, bean salad, potatoes in hot and cold dishes, such as potato salad and potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer), served with sour creme, applesauce.Pennsylvania Dutch descendants are noted for maintaining authentic, German cooking traditions, maintaining old-world recipes and flavors for cen-turies after establishing their communities in the New World.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Page 10Similar to what is found in many American com-munities, the Amana Colonies of Iowa (sometimes confused with being Amish) are famous for Ger-man-style meals served family-style.Freshly baked rolls and breads are certain to start a meal, often complemented by a tasty and hot cheese fondue and accompanied with a cheerful pint of good German beer.More beer follows the main course, topped off with a compelling choice of tortes and cakes, or perhaps a dessert wine. One thing is certain: all the meals will feature an abundant selection and unlimited supply.During special occasions, German-Americans de-sire traditional meals, handed down through gen-erations, to remind them of their ethnic heritage. These traditional “meat-and-potatoes” dishes have become synonymous in many areas as traditional American, with minor variation. Nothing at the dinner table requires much extravagance. Potatoes or noodles, complemented with simple vegetables, properly prepared with the right sauces, produce excellent results.Whether they are seeking libations from a Ger-man restaurant or from the home of a good friend, Germans are comforted by two thoughts: they will be in good like-minded company, and they know for certain that they will never leave hungry.Potatoes and NoodlesGerman cuisine places a particularly high impor-tance on potatoes, rice, and noodles. Any meal that includes meat (which is almost every main meal) fea-tures one of these, which were once primarily used as a “filler” to make up for smaller meat portions.When meat became more plentiful, they remained a big part of the meals as a “Sossentraeger” to soak up the flavors captured in the meat juices or gravy.In Swabia, Spätzle noodles long-ago replaced po-tatoes in traditional meals. Made from a flour-egg dough cut or pressed directly into boiling water, Spätzle can be served plain alongside a roast and its gravy. It can also be combined with the locally available cheese, Allgauer Emmentaler, to make Käse Spätzle, with sauerkraut to make Kraut Spät-zle, or served together with lentils and bacon as a single-dish meal.Vegetarians can enjoy a German meal, along with their meat-eating counterparts by simply request-ing a plate of potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer) and a side of Kase Spatzle. Yum!Marinades and Pickled BrinesImportant, distinguishing characteristics of German cuisine are pickled and marinated dishes. These recipes are prepared with a sauce comprised of competing elements of vinegar and sugar, hon-ey, or fruit. The result is often the delicate blend of sweet and sour that is the characteristic taste of German food.* Soaked in a spicy sauce, Sauerbraten marinates for two to four days to develop its distinctive fla-vors.* Herring (fish) absorbs its unique taste from being pickled in a mixture of vinegar and juniper berries.* Sauerkraut is finely shredded cabbage, soaked in a salty brine and fermented up to several weeks. It can be a side-dish, condiment, or used in main-dish recipes.Dessert SpecialtiesA popular dessert from central Germany are the '),\n",

Another well-known Christmas treat is Dresdner Stollen.The Back Forest Cake and the German Choc-olate cake, frosted with almond icing, are other common examples of German desserts often found in America.Especially delightful are regional German-Amer-ican desserts when the right ingredients are in season. For instance, each German restaurant in Iowa offers its own unique take on fresh-off-the farm rhubarb pies, with variations of either a single or double crust, or a meringue topping.  BeerWhen arriving on American soil, many German immigrants founded breweries. Some of the earliest are located in Wisconsin and Missouri. Many of America’s largest breweries and its up-and-coming microbreweries were founded by German-Ameri-cans in a never-ending quest for the perfect beer.Trivia: One of Germany’s favorite pork dishes is said to be named for the central German town of Kassel: Kasseler Rippchen. (These smoked pork chops are served individually or as a rack of roast, along with a high pile of sauerkraut and potatoes.)Off-season VariationsDuring the long and cold months of winter, the monotony of meat dishes, such as the usual stews and roasts, is enhanced with dried fruits. German cooking often boasts flavors blended with apples, pears, raisins, and prunes. If fruit is not added during the cooking process, it is often served as a side dish. Applesauce and freshly grated horserad-ish accompany boiled beef and mild sausage.When fresh vegetables are not plentiful, there is an added importance on potatoes, fresh breads, and sweet desserts to accompany simple main meals.Whatever the season, each meal is carefully pre-pared to promote comfort and love, just the right blend of Gemütlichkeit.Guten Appetit!'),\n",

The key for either method is to very slowly add oil, in a steady stream, while the processor is running or you’re whisking vigorously. (Hint: to stabilize a lightweight mixing bowl, set it on a coiled kitchen towel.)If the mayonnaise is too thick, add enough water to thin it to desired consistency, about a teaspoon at a time.

Rest for 10 minutes.Roll dough into strings and then twist dough pieces in the middle. Pick up the dough string with two hands each hand holding one end. Attach the ends to the dough in a pretzel shape. Place pretzel on a baking sheet and allow to proof until pretzels doubles in thickness.Create egg wash by whisking the eggs with water and brush on top of pretzel after they have proofed. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown. Dip in pre-pared mustard, if desired. Yields 10 pretzels.Variations:As the Pretzels are removed from the oven, a sec-ond glaze of melted butter is applied, it goes deep into the soft crust as they cool, to create that lovely chewy texture that you get in the parks.Many Amish markets have wonderful buttery yet crisp brown soft pretzels that they make by hand if front of the customers. To add to the butter flavor, they put them in a container of melted (clarified) butter and hang them to dry under a heat lamp.Alkaline BathTo add to the distinctive ‘Pretzel’ flavor, and the rich chestnut color, comes from a water/baking soda glaze that are the pretzels are either dipped into, or onto which they are brushed before baking.The optimal method is to boil the pretzels in an alkaline bath for about a minute. Lye is used commercially, but should not be used at home due to the lack of  ‘food grade lye’ and due to safety problems making small batches of lye water.At home, mix 3/4 cup baking soda to 6 cups of water. You may make the baking soda even more alkaline, spread it on a baking sheet and heat for 1-2 hours at 250 or 300 degrees.Potato Bread (Kartoﬀelbrot)[This is a recipe of the Pennsylvania Dutch.]1 medium-sized potato, peeled and diced2½ cups water2 tablespoons shortening1½ tablespoons sugar2 teaspoons salt6 cups bread flour, divided1 package dry yeast'),\n",

Many of Cincinnati’s early settlers came from Germany; some were sausage makers. Goetta evolved from a similar dish made in some parts of Germany. It is very similar to oatmeal sausage, except for the shape and final preparation. Goetta is a breakfast sausage of German-American origin and is nor-mally a breakfast dish, served with eggs, but is also served as the main dish at lunch or supper. It can be served with grape jelly, ketchup, mustard, syrup, apple butter, honey, or eaten by itself.][The word “Goetta” comes from the High German word “grütze” and Low German word grötte. North of Cincinnati it is often known by the term “grits”, not to be confused with American hominy grits. Originally a peasant dish meant to stretch out serv-ings of meat over several meals to conserve money, goetta has become an all-purpose food eaten with any meal. It is available in groceries stores and new goetta-based products in the Cincinnati area include goetta burgers, goetta dogs and goetta pizza.]8 cups water3 teaspoons saltpinch of pepper2½ cups pin-head or steel cut oatmeal*1 pound beef and 1 pound pork, ground together1 large onion, sliced, and 1 to 4 bay leaves, or 2 teaspoons dried summer savorybacon fatPut the water into a pan; bring to a boil.

Close the opening with skewers; fasten the neck skin to the back of the goose with a skewer and truss the bird.For a crisper skin, prick the surface around the thighs, the back, and the lower part of the breast with the tip of a small, sharp knife. Place the goose, breast side up, on a rack set in a large, shallow roasting pan, and roast, uncovered, in the center of the oven for 3-3½ hours, or about 20 minutes per pound.As the fat accumulates in the pan, draw it off with a bulb baster or large kitchen spoon and save for Gänseschmalz, if you like. It is not necessary to baste the goose. To test for doneness, prick the thigh of the bird with a fork; if the juice that runs out is still tinged with pink, roast the goose anoth-er 5 to 10 minutes.For easier carving, let the goose sit in the turned-off oven with the door ajar for 15 minutes.

Serves 6.Pickled and Fermented Cabbage (Sauerkraut)Sauerkraut is a naturally fermented cabbage and is very easy to make. A process called lacto-fer-mentation has been used for centuries in Germany to preserve seasonal vegetables. Natural fermen-tation is one of the oldest means of food preserva-tion that inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria, reducing the risk of food-borne illness and food spoilage.The process is very reliable and safe. It requires no special equipment and produces consistent re-sults. The process simply combines shredded cab-bage with some salt and packs it into a container. A crock pot is great for large batches, but a mason jar will do fine for small batches.Adding salt to shredded cabbage releases natural juices that contain sugars that become the food source for the bacterial fermentation. Beneficial bacteria present on the surface of the cabbage leaves convert these sugars into lactic acid in the naturally-occurring brine (salt) solution.Submerged in this liquid for a period of several days or weeks, the cabbage slowly ferments into the crunchy, sour condiment we know and love as sauerkraut.The minimum time needed is about two to three days, though the kraut will continue to ferment and become tastier for many days thereafter. The best rule of thumb is to keep tasting the kraut and refrigerate when it tastes good to you.The sauerkraut is safe to eat at every stage of the process, so there is no real minimum or maximum fermentation time. The fermented sauerkraut can be kept at cellar temperature (around 55°F) for months. Alternatively, you can store the kraut in a refrigerator. Besides preserving the cabbage and creating a food that is incredibly tasty, it provides additional health benefits, since the fermented sauerkraut contains very healthy probiotics.Sauerkraut is a low-calorie food, at only 42 calo-ries per cup, and a good source of vitamin C, at 30 mg. per cup. However, it requires a high amount of salt necessary to regulate the fermentation, at about 1,500 mg. sodium per cup. [Note: You can reduce the sodium content — as well as the tartness — by rinsing sauerkraut in cold water before using.]Salt: Use a non-iodized pickling or canning salt, as iodine will prevent the bacterial fermentation necessary. It is available at most supermarkets. Add between 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent salt by weight. Cutting: Shred cabbage using a large, sharp knife, a special kraut cutter, or food processor.Crock or Container: Sauerkraut is prepared entirely in a brining crock. An old-fashioned earthenware crock with a capacity ranging from 2 to 20 gallons is the traditional container. However, an expensive stoneware crock is not required. The required “crock” can be any unchipped enamel pot or large glass jar.For larger batches, an untinted, 5-gallon plastic food-grade container will hold about 25 pounds of prepared cabbage. Do not use metal containers of any type. The old adage “A hand in the pot spoils the lot” is completely true. Keep your hands, and any metal object, out of the crock. Use wooden spoons and mashers and glass or crockery for dipping and weighing. Potentiality harmful bacteria on your skin can overtake the beneficial bacteria that will be produced, ruining the batch.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'german_recipe_book.pdf', 'page': 80}, page_content='Page 72The best and freshest ingredients will yield the best sauerkraut. You can make relish with your old, tough cabbage, but use your young, fresh, tender cabbage for your sauerkraut.DirectionsRemove defective and coarse outer leaves from the cabbage. This will also get rid of residual insec-ticide spray. Cut away spoiled or damaged spots. Rinse heads lightly in cold water to remove surface dust and visible dirt particles. Drain.Cut heads into halves or quarters and core. Slice or shred the cabbage so that the shred is as long and thin as possible. If using a food processor, you may not get the fine characteristic shred typical in commercial brands, but it will not affect the fer-mentation or the final results.Weigh the cabbage. Place the first 5 pounds in a sterilized pan or bowl. For every 5 pounds of cabbage, sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the pure canning or pickling salt. Mix well to uniformly distribute the salt. Allow the salted cabbage to stand 5 to 10 minutes to wilt slightly and begin to draw out the natural juices.Pack the cabbage into a crock or other suitable container. Pound the cabbage firmly with a wood-en tamper until juices cover the cabbage. Repeat this procedure layer by layer, until the container is filled to the desired depth and the cabbage is com-pletely covered with 1 to 2 inches of juice. Leave at least 4 to 5 inches between the cabbage and the top of the container.A water-filled plastic bag is an easy way to both completely cover and weigh down the cabbage. It is important to ensure that it is completely sub-merged. It is absolutely essential that you cover the cabbage and liquid to exclude air, since the fermentation process requires anaerobic conditions (without oxygen).Use a non-tinted, heavy-duty, watertight plastic bag intended for food. Clear freezer bags sold for packaging turkeys are suitable for use with 5-gal-lon containers. Fill the bag with salted water (6 tablespoons salt in 1 gallon water) to a depth of 3 or 4 inches, allowing the bag to completely cover the cabbage. Tie closed securely.Place the container of cabbage in a well-ventilat-ed area with a relatively constant temperature. It is desirable maintain the container at room tempera-ture (68 to 72 degrees F) during the first several days to begin production of the acid that will preserve the cabbage.Kept at room temperature, the kraut should be ready in 3 to 4 weeks. At higher temperatures, fer-mentation will proceed more rapidly and the kraut will be ready sooner.Conversely, if kept at temperatures lower than 68 degrees F, fermentation will slow, and may be incomplete if the temperature drops below 60 de-grees F. If kept in a garage or basement where the temperature might drop below freezing, fermenta-tion will stop, but it will commence again when the temperature rises into a favorable range.Check the container daily. During the fermenta-tion, film yeasts or molds may form on the liq-uid’s surface. If they appear, skim them off. If any discoloration appears within the top inch of kraut, remove it. If you are using a cloth covering, rinse or replace it each time you remove scum or spoiled cabbage.Long-Term StorageThere are four alternatives for storing sauerkraut after fermentation is complete. Canning and freez-ing are preferable for maintaining the best quality.CanningHeat well-fermented sauerkraut and liquid to simmering (185 to 200 degrees F). Do not boil. Pack hot kraut into clean, hot canning jars, and '),\n",

If there is not enough sauerkraut juice to cover all the kraut in the jars, use a boiling hot, weak brine comprised of 2 table-spoons salt for each quart of water. Place a properly pretreated lid on each jar. Pretreat lids according to manufacturer’s instructions.FreezingPack sauerkraut and juice in rigid plastic mois-ture- or vapor-proof freezer containers; in glass freezer jars (leaving 1½ inches headspace for ex-pansion); or in heavy, tightly sealed plastic freezer bags. Freeze.Refrigerating (Shorter-term storage)The kraut may also be placed in tightly closed jars or sealed freezer bags and stored in the refrig-erator for as long as several months.Leaving in the Crock (Shorter-term storage)If you have a cool basement, garage or other stor-age area, the sauerkraut may be kept in the crock indefinitely as long as the top surface is not ex-posed to air, which may cause spoilage. No refrig-eration is required. After removing portions, cover and weigh-down. A small amount of spoilage may appear after each opening, which can be removed upon subsequent openings.Making Small AmountsThis method is convenient if you make into sauerkraut only a head or two of cabbage at a time. Making small amounts may result in more losses due to spoilage. Use any type of 2-quart standard canning jar that is free from nicks, chips or cracks. Sterilize the jar, lid and other utensils to be used in packing the kraut by placing in boiling water for 10 minutes.Select and prepare cabbage as directed in the in-structions for making a larger batch of sauerkraut. Shred the cabbage into a sterilized pan or bowl. A 2-quart jar will hold about 3-1/3 pounds of shred-ded cabbage.To this amount, add 2 tablespoons plus 1 tea-spoon canning or pickling salt. Thoroughly mix salt into the cabbage. Allow the salted cabbage to stand for 5 to 10 minutes to wilt somewhat and begin to draw out juices.Pack the cabbage firmly into the jar, filling it to the top. Press down firmly until juice runs out of the cabbage and covers it completely. Put the sterilized lid on the jar just tightly enough to keep out air. Set the jar on a tray or in a pan to collect juice that may leak out during active fermentation. Keep the jar at room temperature (68 to 72 degrees F) until the bubbling stops. This will usually take 2 to 3 weeks.Note: Do not pour the juice that bubbles out back into the jar. When the bubbling stops, check to be sure that there is still enough liquid to cover the kraut. If there is not, replace the juice that has bub-bled out with a boiling hot, weak brine comprised of 2 tablespoons salt per quart of water. Re-tighten the cover securely, wipe the outside of the jar, and store in the refrigerator or a very cool place until you use it up.When ready to eat, to maximize the flavors, heat sauerkraut thoroughly. An interesting and mellow alternative is to add a little brown sugar, chopped apple and onion, and simmer slowly. Rinsing kraut with water before using will produce a milder fla-vor and also remove some of the salt.Sauerkraut can be used in appetizers, dips, soups, relishes, salads, entrées, and even desserts. It is also a good vegetable companion for corned beef, spare-ribs, frankfurters, sausages, pork hocks, poultry, or game.A newer way to use kraut is as a sauce, dip, or potato topping.

Place a cut apple in the container if cookies become too hard.Note: Lemon or almond flavoring can be substituted for the anise. After cookies have cooled, the design may be painted with food coloring and a fine brush.

With a sharp knife cut dough around the pattern. Let the cut dough cool and trim away excess.If stained glass windows are desired, place crushed hard candy into window openings and return to oven for 1 minute or until the candy is melted. (Watch to prevent burning!)Icing: Beat the egg white until foamy; add the powdered sugar. Beat until smooth. Pour into a pastry tube to use. Icing remaining after assembly may be divided and tinted with the food coloring for decorating.*Assembling: Gingerbread pieces must be thor-oughly cool. Join the pieces together with the icing. Dip the edges of smaller pieces into the icing. (Canned goods are useful for propping the pieces while drying.)Decorating: After all the pieces have been as-sembled and are completely dry, the true artist is revealed through frosting, decorative flourishes, and candy. Windows, shingles, porches, and other architectural accents can be created. This is defi-nitely the most enjoyable part of creating a ginger-bread house.*Icing with uncooked egg white is for decorating only.House PatternsIncluded on the next two pages are a couple of simple house design options.[Lynn Hattery-Beyer says: “The easiest house for beginners to attempt consists of four pieces: two square slabs of gingerbread for the roof and two rectangular pieces for the front and back. The roof is not held up by walls, but rather rests on the surface, making construction simple. Cut the patterns out of heavy cardboard. The size doesn’t really matter—whatever you are prepared to decorate is fine!“Cut out two gingerbread pieces using each pattern. Feel free to cut windows and a door in the front and back pieces. This simple pattern can be upgraded easily by adding side walls as long as the roof is wide, and the front/back pieces must be lengthened to accommodate the height of the side walls. For variety in decorating you can use licorice, chocolate wafers, candied fruit, gum drops, and nuts.”]'),\n",
